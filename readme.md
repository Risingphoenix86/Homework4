The goal of theis assignment was to create a working example of a coding quiz to help familarize me with coding assesments that I may see in the future.
An example gif was provided and was used to determine basic styling. functions were made for each part of the assignemnt, from loading score arrays to determining if entry was the correct answer.
a timer was implemented as well, to limit the amount of time someone could spend on the test, with incorrect answers ending the test early.
